## Overview

This project presents an analysis of past film data that aims to provide concrete recommendations to Thunderhouse Films, an emerging film studio. It analyzes production budgets, box office revenue, genres, and release times in order to predict the most profitable strategy for producing and releasing films. Descriptive analysis and regression analysis of production budget and gross sales data show that horror films in the mid-budget range bring in the highest returns on investment, especially when released in the weeks leading to Halloween. Thunderhouse films can use our analysis to target movies with the highest ROI as they launch their new movie studio and later expand.

## Business Problem

Entering the movie business requires a certain level of risk and capital allocation. By analyzing data of past films, we hope to devise a strategy that will make the most effective use of each dollar our client spends as a new film studio. The most important metric in this case is the Return on Investment (ROI) from each film, since producing a film is an expensive endeavor and we want to ensure the payoff is maximized. We saw three main categories that a new entrant into the industry would need to consider. These include how much to spend on a film, what genre to produce, and when to release the film. We first start off by segmenting the market into low, mid, and high-budget films, as these three segments all differ in their optimal strategy. We then use the main genre associated with each film to look across our market segments for the highest median ROI, in order to account for outliers. Finally, we assess the best time to release a film by analyzing our top genre across each month of the year to find where films repeatedly yield high returns.
